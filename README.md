### Restaurant tier list website for HackMIT 2022

Our application is a platform built on a MERN stack that takes input from users to collect restaurant reviews and creates rankings for restaurants using this data stream. The difference between our system and traditional, widely-available restaurant review platforms, however, is that ours employs letters instead of numbers as a metric for quality and overall experience at a restaurant. We were inspired to create this application after discovering research which found that numeric ratings are an unreliable source of food satiety due to the difficulty for the human brain to perceive small variations in numbers, suggesting that letters could be a better alternative (https://doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.37328). Another difference is that the intended scope of our platform is to allow a few close friends to share preferences with each other, rather than a massive review database like Yelp or Google Maps that might be clouded by opinions from others with dissimilar tastes.
